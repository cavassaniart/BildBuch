# BildBuch

First, this is a personal project. It's an effort  to create something based in a need of mine, and, at same time, learn other creative language.

The programm primary objective is to help with creative projects, organizing users files in a folder, reading, tagging and grouping them. That way, the user can search and operate these files to easily execute projects.

The programme structure is divided in two parts: database (.txt) and interface (PySimpleGUI). Initially I made all in one script only, but it's intended to divide it in modules and update to a true database file with SQLite3, to later increase new functions.
